# Robot–Child Emotion Recognition Scripts

This repository contains structured interaction scripts designed for robot-assisted sessions with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The goal is to enhance **emotion recognition** skills through guided play and dialogue.

## Contents

* **Scripts Buddy.pdf**

  * Structured activities for children aged **4–7**.
  * The robot *Buddy* helps children explore emotions such as **joy, anger, and fear** through simple games (e.g., blowing bubbles, puzzles, balloons).

* **Scripts Navel.pdf**

  * Structured activities for children aged **8–10**.
  * The robot *Navel* supports recognition of **joy, anger, sadness, and fear** using age-appropriate play and storytelling (e.g., playground games, construction blocks, toys, social stories).

## Purpose

These scripts provide therapists, educators, and researchers with structured scenarios for:

* Introducing a social robot to a child in a natural, engaging way.
* Using **play-based interaction** to elicit and recognize basic emotions.
* Reinforcing emotion understanding with tools such as **emotion cards**, **toys**, and **storytelling prompts**.
* Encouraging children to identify emotions in both themselves and the robot.

## How It Works

Each session follows a **guided structure**:

1. **Introduction** – The child is introduced to the robot (Buddy or Navel) with the support of an adult facilitator.
2. **Emotion-focused activities** – The robot expresses emotions during simple scenarios. The child is invited to recognize and label the emotion.
3. **Reinforcement** – Use of cards to strengthen the association between situation and emotion.
4. **Farewell activity** – Combines multiple emotions to review what was learned.

## Intended Use

* Designed for **therapeutic and educational settings**.
* Should be used under the guidance of trained professionals (therapists, educators, or researchers).
* Adaptable for individual sessions or small-group interventions.
